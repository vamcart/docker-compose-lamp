# Allows HTTPS on localhost. You will need to use mkcert on your local machine
# to create the `cert.pem` and `cert-key.pem` files, and then place them in the
# `./config/ssl` directory. You could also create certificates for any local
# testing domain you wish such as `localapp.test`, you will then edit your hosts
# file to map that domain name to 127.0.0.1 and then configure your vhosts below
# accordingly:
